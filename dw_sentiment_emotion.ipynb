Ellen Pollock, our Business editor, has responded to readers who voiced criticism over our recent story on bubble tea.  We published a feature article on Thursday about bubble tea becoming \\u201cmainstream,\\u201d which drew criticism from readers on two fronts. Some thought that the article read as though we had just discovered bubble tea. (In fact, The Times published an article in December proclaiming bubble tea \\u201cso 2002.\\u201d) Other readers thought we described the drink, which was created in Taiwan, as strange and alien, and especially took us to task for the use of the word \\u201cblobs.\\u201d This is how one reader, Bo Hee Kim, very thoughtfully put it: The reader complaints have merit. In retrospect, we wish we had approached the topic differently (if at all). There may be a story in the expansion of bubble tea businesses in the United States, but there is no denying the drink has been around for quite a while. And we regret the impression left by some of the original language in the article, which we have revised in light of the concerns. We thank our readers for sharing their views.\",\n          \"The caves of Matera, Italy, the lost mansions of India, Washington State\\u2019s Hoh Rain Forest, and more: T has traveled far and wide in 2017.

There are no books on my night stand, because I\\u2019m a lifelong insomniac, so eight or nine years ago, I thought: \\u201cDon\\u2019t read in bed. It\\u2019s too stimulating. Watch TV instead. It\\u2019s boring.\\u201d And it\\u2019s true. TV is boring, but apparently not boring enough to make me fall asleep. So now instead of being overstimulated and awake, I\\u2019m bored and awake. What has your postelection reading looked like? My postelection reading has looked pretty much like tea leaves, with just exactly the success you might imagine. I\\u2019ve definitely noticed since the election that even though generally I have a lifelong preference for reading fiction, I have less interest in it now. Except for rereading, which I\\u2019ve been doing a lot. Especially John O\\u2019Hara. I suppose this is my way of comforting myself. What\\u2019s the last great book you read? This really kind of stumped me. Unlike almost everyone else I can think of, when I say great, I mean great. Not just great this year or not just extremely good. I know you\\u2019re not supposed to have this kind of old-fashioned hierarchy of books. But I do. So I\\u2019m trying to think of the last really great book I read. And all I can come up with is something I reread, which was \\u201cMemoirs of Hadrian,\\u201d by Marguerite Yourcenar, which is actually great, and by great, I mean forever. What\\u2019s the best classic novel you recently read for the first time? \\u201cLittle Dorrit.\\u201d I never was a Dickens fanatic. Except for \\u201cMartin Chuzzlewit,\\u201d which I loved. But I was looking for something to read and I asked Deborah Eisenberg and she said, \\u201cHave you ever read \\u2018Little Dorrit\\u2019?\\u201d Which I had not, and I was so startled \\u2014 since she rarely recommends a book that wasn\\u2019t written by a dead Hungarian \\u2014 that I immediately read it, and I loved it. What\\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of?  This is a question that I really find odd. How do I know what no one else has heard of? I can name books that I think are fairly obscure. I could say Henry Green. But now, as of last summer, everyone is reading Henry Green. There is a writer named Wyndham Lewis, whom you\\u2019re supposed to hate, but I don\\u2019t. He wrote a book called, \\u201cThe Apes of God,\\u201d which is a book I particularly like and am interested in. I suppose other people like it and have heard of it, but I assume it is obscure enough for this answer. Which writers \\u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \\u2014 working today do you admire most?  This is something I usually avoid answering, because you always leave someone out. But I wrote up a list. Toni Morrison, Deborah Eisenberg, Lynne Tillman, Wallace Shawn, Junot D\\u00edaz, Ben Katchor and Cynthia Ozick. Who is shockingly smart. Whose opinion on books do you most trust? Mine. When do you read? Pretty much all the time. Especially if I\\u2019m supposed to be doing something else. I was very frequently punished for reading as a child because I was reading when I was supposed to be doing homework. I got in trouble in school for reading, I got in trouble at home for reading. My mother would actually bang on my door and say, \\u201cI know you\\u2019re reading in there!\\u201d In my adult life, I\\u2019ve gotten in trouble for reading because I\\u2019m not writing when I\\u2019m reading. So it\\u2019s really rare that reading is unaccompanied by guilt for me. But I\\u2019ve learned to live with it. I feel guilty pretty much all the time. The only time I read without feeling guilty is on a plane, because what else could I possibly be doing? What moves you most in a work of literature? I think it might be the word \\u201cmove\\u201d that kind of perplexes me, because that\\u2019s a word connected with emotion. I don\\u2019t really seek out emotion when reading. The feeling that\\u2019s most important to me when reading is that I\\u2019m absorbed. I just want to be taken away. I really like being dazzled. That would be nice. The thing I care least about in reading is the story. I just don\\u2019t care that much about stories. That may have to do with being older. Tell me a story I don\\u2019t know. But really, I read in order not to be in life. Reading is better than life. Without reading, you\\u2019re stuck with life. Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? In my lifetime, I\\u2019ve read one zillion mysteries. This is not because I care about who did it. I don\\u2019t care. And I almost never figure it out. I don\\u2019t have that kind of mind at all. I don\\u2019t care who did it. I have reread mysteries numerous times and I don\\u2019t even remember who did it. I\\u2019ve read all the Agatha Christies. I\\u2019ve read all the Nero Wolfe books by Rex Stout. He wrote many of them, but not enough for Fran. I\\u2019m always hoping to find one I\\u2019ve never read. It\\u2019s the same as the New Yorker\\u2019s dream of finding an extra room in your apartment that you didn\\u2019t know was there. One thing I like about mysteries is that they end. Which is true of so little else. I have avoided science fiction my entire life, or any kind of fantasy. When the Harry Potter books came out, I bought the first one because everyone said how great it was. But I didn\\u2019t like it. And I realized I would not have liked it as a child either. I\\u2019m not saying I don\\u2019t love her, because she did a great thing. To see children lined up outside bookstores \\u2014 that was fantastic. But those kinds of books. .\\\\u2008.\\\\u2008. It\\u2019s like adventures or people who climb mountains or jump out of airplanes I find real life challenging enough. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously?  Obviously, paper. I mean, actually, on his show once, Jimmy Fallon gave me a Kindle. He actually gave it to me as a present. I said: \\u201cI know you gave me this because I don\\u2019t have one. You know what else I don\\u2019t have? A Bentley.\\u201d I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re horrible. I don\\u2019t object to them. I\\u2019m just not interested in them. People are always showing me this stuff like I\\u2019m from outer space and I\\u2019ve never heard of it. I have really bad eyesight, so they always tell me you can make the type bigger. I suppose that would be a good thing for me, but I don\\u2019t care. I\\u2019d rather squint. I see people using them on the subway. It seems to me that the majority of people you see reading on these things are in their 40s. I see fewer kids reading on them, and by kids I mean people in their 20s. These are the people I see most frequently reading actual books, which I find very encouraging. How do you organize your books? My books are organized first by category. Fiction, letters, essays. Those kinds of categories. And then there are many subdivisions. Then within categories, they\\u2019re alphabetized. I always have arguments with the guy who helps me organize my books, because I have a biography section. He says: \\u201cYou can\\u2019t have a biography section. You have to have them arranged by writer. For instance, Henry James\\u2019s fiction, then the letters, the biographies, etc.\\u201d And I say: \\u201cI know. That\\u2019s the right way to do it. But that would take up too much space.\\u201d All the apartments I buy or rent are for my books, not for myself. I don\\u2019t need the space. I\\u2019m 5-foot-4. I have a whole bookcase that this guy calls \\u201cyour crazy books.\\u201d The crazy book category. Those books are not alphabetized. I also have a large reference library. I have numerous encyclopedias I have many, many dictionaries. I actually bought myself the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1978. I always wanted it, and when I wrote my first book and had some money, I bought it. I didn\\u2019t have it growing up I had the World Book, because it was less expensive. The Encyclopaedia Britannica was so hard to buy, I can\\u2019t tell you. I had to make one million phone calls. Because it was generally sold on an installment plan. They didn\\u2019t know how to send these books to someone who is just going to send a check. Nobody uses these books anymore, but I do. When the second edition of the O.E.D. came out, there was nothing I wanted more. It was like $10,000. I had a friend who owned a bookstore, and I begged her to let me buy it at cost, and she did. It was still several thousand dollars, but I\\u2019m delighted to own it, even though I think it\\u2019s now free on the internet. You\\u2019re in the process of moving your personal library. What\\u2019s that been like?  Believe me, I\\u2019m not in the process of it yet. Because it\\u2019s so awful, I keep putting it off. But I just did it a year and a half ago. They come and pack the books. That takes three days. But two times before that, it took two months to organize them first. I have many bookcases. They have glass doors. They are mostly 19th-century. The books all go in certain places in my apartment. I like to have fiction in the living room, reference books in the writing room. I have 10,000 books. I know this because I move them. When I move, I go through them and take some out. Many books come to this house unbidden. And unbidden books, I don\\u2019t want to keep them. Once the books are all rearranged, I can put my hand on any book. I know where they all are. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I don\\u2019t know. Maybe my small library of soap carving books, because most people don\\u2019t have them. People are surprised at the fairly large number of cookbooks I have, because I don\\u2019t cook. I hate cooking, and I never cook. But I like to eat, and I like to read about food. The very first book in my library was a book my mother bought me at a house sale in the late 1950s called \\u201cSix Little Cooks.\\u201d She bought it for a quarter. I couldn\\u2019t believe that I was allowed to have such a beautiful thing. This was my first book that I thought of as very valuable. It\\u2019s a story about a woman who goes to visit her niece and her friends and decides to spend the summer teaching them how to cook. It\\u2019s signed by the author and all the girls. Maybe because of this book, and maybe because they used to be so cheap (they no longer are), I have quite a few cookbooks. What\\u2019s the best book you\\u2019ve ever received as a gift? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019ve received some really wonderful books as gifts. I have some first editions of Dawn Powell, whom I love. I would never buy these books. I buy books to read. It adds about 80 zillion dollars to the price of a book to have a signed or first edition. I have some first edition Thurbers. I\\u2019m thrilled to have them, believe me. I got a first edition Thurber for my birthday this year, and that was the last book to make me laugh out loud when I reread it. I got kicked out of class in third grade reading Thurber. I couldn\\u2019t contain myself. I could not stop laughing. But not all funny writers are necessarily funny in that way. Oscar Wilde is probably the wittiest writer in English, but he doesn\\u2019t make me laugh out loud. There was a writer named Peter De Vries who did make me laugh out loud, so hard that when I was reading one of his books when I was in the hospital as a teenager, the nurse took it away from me because she thought I was going to break my stitches. Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?  I don\\u2019t really have these kinds of favorites. I probably had them as a child. I associate having favorite things with being a child. I\\u2019m not youthful enough to have these kinds of favorites. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I was a constant reader. Just like I am now. I was constantly reading. I read under the covers with a flashlight. I loved \\u201cThe Secret Garden.\\u201d The ones every girl my age read. I also have a lot of my mother\\u2019s books. Mostly I went to the library as a child. \\u201cHeidi,\\u201d Nancy Drew. I would say mostly conventional kinds of books. You\\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? None. I would never do it. My idea of a great literary dinner party is Fran, eating alone, reading a book. That\\u2019s my idea of a literary dinner party. When I eat alone, I spend a lot of time, before I sit down to my meager meal, choosing what to read. And I\\u2019m a lot better choosing a book than preparing a meal. And I never eat anything without reading. Ever. If I\\u2019m eating an apple, I have to get a book. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn\\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? I wouldn\\u2019t say disappointing or not good, but I will say that I have never enjoyed reading William Faulkner. I am not saying he\\u2019s not a great writer. I will just say that I prefer not to read him. I don\\u2019t enjoy reading him. I did not acquire the ability to not finish a book until I was 50 years old, which probably has to do with scarcity as a child: You have a book \\u2014 finish it! But I\\u2019ve made a number of decisions since then. If you don\\u2019t like a book, stop reading it. If you don\\u2019t like a movie, walk out. Life is not a jail sentence. When I used to be able to go into bookstores all the time, when there were lots of bookstores, I could read a few sentences and put it down. Now I hear about a book and get someone to order it on the internet, and when the book arrives I find I don\\u2019t like it. I only read for pleasure. I don\\u2019t have to finish a book. Sometimes, I don\\u2019t realize how little I care about a book. Sometimes, I start reading a book and then realize I forgot I was reading it. And it disappears under a pile of books. Whom would you want to write your bio?  I would say Carolyn Keene. Because then at least I know they would find the culprit. If I\\u2019d known Carolyn Keene was not a person as a child, I would have been crushed. All women my age loved Nancy Drew books. In the \\u201980s, they had this Nancy Drew party to celebrate some new editions, and every single woman writer in New York was there, dying to talk about Nancy Drew. There weren\\u2019t many books about girls, let\\u2019s face it. It was pretty uncommon. What do you plan to read next? I don\\u2019t plan my reading. I really don\\u2019t. I\\u2019m always surprised. I can\\u2019t believe that people keep these lists of the books they read. People are so organized! This is a cast of mind so different from mine. I do have piles of books that I haven\\u2019t read yet. When I finish a book, I go through that pile. I recently noticed a book that hadn\\u2019t been read through two moves. I\\u2019ll give it to someone. It\\u2019s a good book. It\\u2019s just not for Fran. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?  It would depend on who\\u2019s reading it to him.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.13305017141068518,\n        \"min\": 0.36153310537338257,\n        \"max\": 0.9908502101898193,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49816,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9175092577934265,\n          0.6970902681350708,\n          0.5141030550003052\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"anger\",\n          \"joy\",\n          \"surprise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.18593005116930114,\n        \"min\": 0.25594159960746765,\n        \"max\": 0.9990140199661255,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49701,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.563707709312439,\n          0.6794393062591553,\n          0.5692220330238342\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
