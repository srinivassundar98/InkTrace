title: "7: Backup in several formats"
---

In this script, we demonstrate a comprehensive approach to backing up data in multiple formats to ensure robustness and redundancy. The process begins by loading data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, which serves as a versatile data structure for manipulation and analysis. Subsequently, this DataFrame is persisted to an SQLite database, offering a compact, reliable storage format ideal for applications requiring local data storage with relational management capabilities.

Additionally, the data is saved in a line-delimited JSON format, providing a human-readable and easily transportable format that's particularly useful for web applications and data interchange. Both the SQLite database file and the JSON file are then compressed into a ZIP archive using LZMA compression, which offers a high compression ratio, effectively reducing storage space and facilitating easier file management and transfer.

Finally, the original SQLite and JSON files are removed from the filesystem to conserve space and maintain data integrity within the zip archive. This process highlights a methodical approach to data backup that can be adapted for various data persistence and backup strategies, ensuring data durability and accessibility across different platforms and environments.

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import os
import json
import zipfile

# Step 1: Load CSV file into DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('main.csv')

# Step 2: Save DataFrame to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('main.db')
df.to_sql('data', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
conn.close()

# Step 3: Save DataFrame to JSON file
df.to_json('main.json', orient='records', lines=True)

# Step 4: Zip the SQLite database and JSON file
with zipfile.ZipFile('data_backup.zip', 'w', compression=zipfile.ZIP_LZMA) as zipf:
    zipf.write('main.db')
    zipf.write('main.json')

# Step 5: Delete the original SQLite and JSON files
os.remove('main.db')
os.remove('main.json')

print("Backup completed and original files removed.")
```
