title: "20: Reproducibility"
---

In our project, we prioritize reproducibility by defining explicit library versions in our requirements.txt. This file ensures a consistent environment across different systems by listing critical libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, plotly for interactive visualizations, and scipy for scientific computing. By specifying versions like scipy==1.11.1, we lock down the environment to stable releases, reducing variability and ensuring that all collaborators can replicate results accurately, essential for maintaining the integrity of our research and development workflows.

The contents of our requirements.txt are as follows:
```yaml
pandas>=1.3
plotly>=5.0
nltk>=3.6
gensim>=4.3.0
pyLDAvis>=3.3
notebook>=6.0  
PyYAML>=5.4
matplotlib>=3.7.2
scipy==1.11.1
numpy>=1.26.4
```
